//! Q What is Java Script ?
//? Java script is Scripting language.
//? It's a synchronous language execute the code step or sequence by sequence.
//? It's an Interpreter language execute the code line by line.
//? It's a client side and server side language.

//! Define Variables.
//? Variables are container used to store DATA or VALUES.
//? Types: >VAR     >LET        >const

// var: Re-assign / Re-declare / Re-initialization
// let: Re-assing
// const: only one time initialization

//! Define Data Types.
//? DATA TYPE defines which type of value is stored in a variable.
//? Types: Primitive  and  Non-Primitive.

// Primitive: pre-define(Let,var,const) - Number, String, Boolean, Null, undefined.
// Non-Primitive user-define(Array,Object,Function).

//? Array ?
// An Array is a collection of multiple data or multiple data type.

//? Object ?
// Collection of key:value pair which is called property.

//? Function ?
// A block of code is called function.

//! Define operators.
//? Operators are operate oprends.
//? Types: Arithmatic(+,-,*,**,%,/)     Comparision(==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=)        Assignment(=)       Logical(&&,||,!)

//! Define control statement.
//? Controls the execution of code.
//? Types:  Conditional statement   and     Looping statement.

//conditional statement: if , if else , if else if , switch , Ternary operator.
//Looping statement: for loop , while , do-while.

//! Function 
//? A block of code is Function.
//? Types: Normal function, Anonymous function, Function expression, Arrow function, IIFE function(imideatly invoked function expression).

//! Scoping
//? scoping says that from where the variable may be accessible in the program and defines the variable range.
//? Types: Global Scope     and     Local scope: Function scope(var)  and  Blocks scope{const, Let}.

//! Hoisting
//? Java interpreter moves the variable declaration and function declaration to the top of the code.

//! Closure 
//? A function inside a function is know as closure.
//? Closure = lexical environment + Function.

//! Methods of ARRAY.
//? push(),  pop(),  shift(),  unshift().
// Call back function: some(), Every(), filter(), map(), forEach().

//! Methods of STRING.
//? toUpperCase(),  toLowerCase(),  trim(),  trimStart(),  trimEnd().

//! Methods of OBJECT.
//? object.keys(),  .values(),  .entries(),  .create(),  .assign(),  .hasOwnProperty().

//! Call by value 
//? means copying a variable value with different Address(reference).
//? works only in primitive datatypes. (changes are made will not affect to any variable value)

//! Call by Reference.
//? Means copying the property or elements of a variable with same address.
//? Works only in Non-primitive data types.

// Shaloow copy: spread operator(...name)  and   assign operator.(target,source)
// Deep copy: JSON.stringify  and   JSON.parse
// Lodash : Deepclone.

//! Define Destructuring.
//? Using the properties and elements of an object or an array as a whole.

//! this - keyword
//? It returns the current object or window.

//! Use strict
//? It is like a reminder that show error while making any of the mistake in code.Like - missing data-type declaration in a variable.

//! Call 
//? It calls the one object property with in another object by passing arguments also. It works with the function only.

//! Type
//? In type work is same as Call but arguments are passed in Array format.

//! Bind 
//? Function is binded and we can call it anywhere at any time.
